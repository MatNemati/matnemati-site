  about: `Hi! I’m Matin Nemati, an undergraduate Electrical Engineering student at Isfahan University of Technology, majoring in Bioelectrics. You can find me on most platforms as MatNemati.
My academic focus is on neuroscience, systems neuroscience, and emerging neurotechnologies. I enjoy tackling complex problems that require algorithmic and creative thinking. I’m also passionate about physics and signal processing and I’m currently exploring possible connections between brain function and quantum phenomena.
(Summer 2025)`,
